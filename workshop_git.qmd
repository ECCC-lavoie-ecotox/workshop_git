## Example slide

### This is a subtitle

Before we dive a bit deeper, here is a simple example of the
[clean theme](https://github.com/grantmcdermott/quarto-revealjs-clean)
in action. 

- No pictures or anything fancy. Just text for the moment.

Next, we'll take a brief tour of some theme components.

- We'll use the same basic
structure as the
[original LaTeX slides](https://raw.githack.com/kylebutts/templates/master/latex-slides/auxiliary/slides.pdf).
- Note that the [_full suite_](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/)
of Reveal.js features are available for this Quarto implementation,
even if we don't cover everything here.


## Before you proceed...

### Requirements for the coding examples in this demo

The [clean theme](https://github.com/grantmcdermott/quarto-revealjs-clean) is
language agnostic. Use it with R, Python, Julia, etc. Or none of the above.

However, this demo uses R code to highlight advanced theme features.
You'll need to install some software if you'd like to render the demo "as-is".

:::{.callout-warning}

## Required software (this demo only)

### R packages

```{.r}
install.packages(c("modelsummary", "fixest", "pdftools", "tinytex", "threejs"))
```
### TinyTex

```{.bash}
quarto install tinytex
```
While reveal.js presentations are HTML format, we will show an example of how to 
embed LaTeX tables as images. This requires a working Tex distribution, of which
TinyTex provides by far the easiest and lightest integration with Quarto. More
details [here](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/pdf-engine.html).

## Components

### Ordered and Unordered Lists

Here we have an unordered list.

- first item
    - sub-item
- second item

And next we have an ordered one.

1. first item
    i) sub-item
2. second item

## Components

### Alerts & Cross-refs {#sec-crossref}

To emphasize specific words or text, you can:

- Use the default `.alert` class, e.g. [important note]{.alert}.
- Use the `.fg` class for custom colour, e.g. [important note]{.fg style="--col: #e64173"}.
- Use the `.bg` class for custom background, e.g. [important note]{.bg style="--col: #e64173"}.

To cross-reference, you have several options, for example:

- Beamer-like `.button` class provided by this theme, e.g. [[Appendix]{.button}](#sec-appendix)
- Quarto's native cross-ref syntax, e.g., "See @sec-appendix."

## Components

### Citations

Citations follow the standard
[Quarto format](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/footnotes-and-citations.html#citations)
and be sourced from BibLaTex, BibTeX, or CLS files. For example:

 - [Topic 1:]{.alert} Spatial Frictions [@Fajgelbaum_Morales_Serrato_Zidar_2018; @Hsieh_Moretti_2019; @Moretti_2011]

- [Topic 2:]{.alert} Blah [@Su√°rez_Serrato_Zidar_2016]

## Components

### Blocks

Quarto provides
[dedicated environments](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/cross-references.html#theorems-and-proofs)
for theorems, lemmas, and so forth. 

But in presentation format, it's arguably more effective just to use a
[Callout Block](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/callouts.html).

:::{.callout-note}
## Regression Specification

The main specification is as follows:

$$
y_{it} = X_{it} \beta + \mu_i + \varepsilon_{it}
$$

## Components

### Multicolumn I: Text only

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
#### Column 1

Here is a long sentence that will wrap onto the next line as it hits the column
width, and continue this way until it stops.
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
#### Column 2

Some other text in another column.

A second paragraph.
:::

::::

Multicolumn support is very flexible and we can continue with a single full
span column in the same slide.

## Components

### Multicolumn II: Text and figures

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
![](img/kanagawa.jpg)
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

- A point about the figure that is potentially important.
- Another point about the figure that is also potentially important.
:::

::::

Note that sub- and multi-panel figures are also natively supported by Quarto.
See [here](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/figures.html#subfigures).
