# <span style="font-weight:lighter;font-size:32px">Workshop 1</span> <br> What is Git, why and how to use it? {background-color="#40666e"}

## What is Git?

- *Git* is a version control system: a software that allows you to track additions and modifications for a set of files within a **folder**, called a **repository**
- Its original purpose was to help groups of developers work collaboratively on big software projects.  
- Think *git* as the “Track Changes” features from Microsoft Word on steroids.

## Git - Context

Compiled software are a bunch of files. At each software improvment, developers want the software to be stable with no regression. For that, they have to know what files have changed between snapshots.

## How *git* helps in science reproducibility

- *Git* is a coding notebook: it documents not only the code but also the coding process
- It makes your code findable and reusable by publishing on a remote repository Github
- All the code source, data and figs are accessible from one location

## In summary

1. Initiate the repository (`git init`)
2. Edit your files
3. Stage the modifications to be committed (`git add`)
4. Create a new commit object (`git commit`)
5. Go back to step 2.
6. Publish your code on the remote server (`git fetch` & `git push`)
7. Go back from vacation
8. Watch if another developer has release new version of the code on the remote repository (`git fetch` & `git pull`)


# How to use Git in practice? {background-color="#40666e"}

## Prerequisites

1. Make sure R version ≥ 4.0 is installed on your computer
2. Install Git:
  - Windows, Install Git for Windows (also known as msysgit or Git Bash) to get Git and tools like the Bash shell.   Download the executable [here](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases/tag/v2.49.0.windows.1)
  - macOS, open a terminal and type: 
      - `git —version` 
      - `git config`
    - If Git isn’t installed, macOS will prompt you to install it.
  - Linux, nothing to do—Git is likely pre-installed.

For more details: https://happygitwithr.com/install-git

## What we're going to do

1. Create a folder 
2. Initiate a git repo for this new folder
3. Create a new R script (file 1) and edit it 
4. Stage this new R script in the git repo
5. Add a commit to document the added file
6. Create a second R script (file 2) in the git repo and edit (file 3)
7. Repeat steps 4 and 5 for this second script
8. Check the git log 
9. Get back to the first commit

## Initiate a Git repo 

In order to reduce the learning curve, we will learn the R Studio way of interacting with git

So many other ways to interact with git:

 - Using R with the `gert` package
 - Using the terminal
 - Using as GUI such as Github Desktop

**All the key concepts and process still the same!**

## Initiate a Git repo 

To use git in Rstudio, you need to create a new Project. Let’s start by creating our project directory.

Open RStudio, in the top right corner create a new project

![](https://valentinlucet.com/git-and-github-with-r-workshop/images/Step_1.png){fig-align="center"}

- Select *New Directory* Note that Version Control is reserved for when you already created a repo on GitHub. 
- Select *New Projects*
- Choose a name for your repo and a location. **Make sure that create a git repository is checked**

## Initiate a Git repo 

You can now look under the *git* tab, you should see this:

![](https://valentinlucet.com/git-and-github-with-r-workshop/images/final.png){fig-align="center"}

## Create a new R script

Create a new file: go to the menu File => New file => R Script. Make sure to save it with the name script_1.R.

**What happens in the git tab?**

### Understand file status

- Files that are **untracked** are represented by a yellow question mark.
- Files that have **been added** (see next section) are represented by a green A
- Files that have **been tracked and modified** are represented by a blue M.
- Files that are **tracked but not modified** do not show.
- Files that have **been delete**d are shown with a red D.

## Stage a new R script

This is as simple as “checking off” the file in the Git tab. This is called Staging the file.

![](https://valentinlucet.com/git-and-github-with-r-workshop/images/checked.png){fig-align="center"}

What is a gitignore? A gitignore is a file that lists the file you never want git to track. It can match certain file names (for instance, .csv or .tif files). This can be useful in case you need to make sure certain files (like data files or large files), do not get added.

## Create a commit

Click on commit on the top of the file list. This window should appear:

![](https://valentinlucet.com/git-and-github-with-r-workshop/images/commit.png){fig-align="center"}

Before committing anything you need to add a commit message. It is important to add a useful message to your commit, a bit like a journal entry, so that you can remember what you committed.

Click on commit in order to commit the changes!

## Edit your script 

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="45%"}
![](https://git-scm.com/images/about/index1@2x.png){fig-align="center"}

:::

::: {.column width="55%"}
- Note that once you have staged a file, you could do more changes, and you would need to re-run git add to add them to the index. Those changes not yet fully registered by git, they are like a draft, not until you commit. 
- When you want to take a snapshot of a file, it means you are ready to commit that change to the index.

# <span style="font-weight:lighter;font-size:32px">Workshop 2</span> <br> What is Github and how to use it to collaborate? {background-color="#40666e"}

## Before we start

Let's make sure you have the following packages installed on your computer:

- `usethis` to create a GitHub token
- `gitcreds` to store the token in your local system

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
install.packages(c("usethis", "gitcreds"))
```

## Review of Workshop 1

In the first workshop, we learned the basics of Git. We covered:

1. How to create a Git repository from an RStudio project  
2. How to stage a file or a group of files 
3. How to make make a commit  
4. View the history of all commits
5. Tell git to ignore files with a `.gitignore` file (relevant for sensitive data)

## `git` Workflow Overview Reminder

The typical workflow:

- **Step 1**: You modify files in your working directory and save them as usual.
- **Step 2:** You stage files to mark your intention to “commit” them (in RStudio this is done by checking the box next to the file in the “Git” tab).
- **Step 3:** You commit the staged files, which permanently stores them as snapshots to your git directory.

:::{.callout-tip}
We can make an analogy with taking a family picture, where each family member would represent a file.

Staging files is like deciding which family member(s) are going to be on your next picture
Committing is like taking the picture
:::

## Git Glossary from Workshop 1

- **Git repository**: A project folder that Git tracks. It contains all the files and a hidden .git folder where Git stores the complete history of changes.
- **Staged file(s)** : Files that are ready to be committed
- **Unstaged file(s)** : Files that are not ready to be committed
- **Untracked file(s)** : Files that are not tracked by Git
- **Commit**: A saved version of your project at a specific point in time (also called snapshot), including a message that explains what changed.

## In this Workshop

- How Git and GitHub work together  
- How to synchronize your local repository:
  - Push your commits to GitHub  
  - Pull your collaborators’ commits from Github
- How conflicts are generated and how to resolve them when applying your collaborators’ commits

## What is Github?

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="40%"}
- Github is a web-based platform.
- Github stored your Git repository on a remote server. 
- Github allows you to backup and make your work foundable and accessible to others.

# Connect your local repository to GitHub {background-color="#40666e"}

## **Step 1.** Create a GitHub account

**Step 1.** For those who don't have an account, [sign up on GitHub using this link](https://github.com/signup?ref_cta=Sign+up&ref_loc=header+logged+out&ref_page=%2F&source=header-home)

![](img/github_signup.png){fig-align="center" width="70%"}

## Step 2. Set up your credentials so GitHub recognizes you

We have to store a *token* in our local system. This token is used to authenticate your computer with Github. 

:::{.callout-tip}
Token = password
:::

## Step 2. Set up your credentials so GitHub recognizes you

**Run the following command in RStudio**

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
usethis::create_github_token()
```

1. This command will open your browser at Github page, log in 
2. Name explictly the token (e.g based on your current R project), copy the token starting with `ghp_`

## Step 2. Set up your credentials so GitHub recognizes you

**Run the following command in RStudio**

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
gitcreds::gitcreds_set()
```

This command will open a prompt in RStudio

![](img/gitcreds_set.png){fig-align="center"}

Paste the token you copied in the previous step

##	Step 3. Connect your local repository to GitHub

Assess if everything is fine and the credentials are OK

**Run the following command in RStudio**

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
usethis::git_sitrep()
```

:::{.callout-note}
This way, you will not have to enter your credentials every time you push or pull from GitHub.
If you want to know more on this authentification process, [have a look at the `usethis` documentation](https://usethis.r-lib.org/articles/git-credentials.html)
:::

##	Step 3. Connect your local repository to GitHub

**Run the following command in RStudio**

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
usethis::use_github()
```

:::{.callout-note}
`usethis::use_github(private = TRUE)` if you want your repository to be private, because you are working with sensitive data
:::

The configuration is done and the local is now sync! 
Lets have a quick look at the Github repo on the website.

## How to synchronize with the remote (Github)?

Lets go back on RStudio and check the Git tab.
Two new buttons `Pull` and `Push` are now available.

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
- **Step 1:** Edit your files
- **Step 2:** `Commit`, move a changed local file to your local staging area 
- **Step 3:** `Pull`, will get the latest remote version and try to merge it with your local version
- **Step 4:** `Push`, will send your local version to the remote version of the repository (in our case GitHub)

# Collaborate to an existing repository {background-color="#40666e"}

## Collaborate to an existing repository

If I'm a collaborator on a project, I need to be able to get the latest version of the code from the remote repository. 

To accomplish this, I **Clone** the remote repository to my local computer. Clone means to copy the entire contents of a GitHub repository to your local computer.

## Collaborate to an existing repository

Navigate to the repository on GitHub and click on Code. Select HTTPS and copy the link.

![](https://pages.github.nceas.ucsb.edu/lter/github-workshop/images/rstudio-6-new-repo-link.png){width="100%"}

## Collaborate to an existing repository

1. And finally, in RStudio, go to **File > New Project > Version Control > Git** 
2. Paste the link you copied from GitHub. 
3. Select a local directory where you want to save the repository.

![](https://pages.github.nceas.ucsb.edu/lter/github-workshop/images/rstudio-11-clone-repo-details.png){width="100%"}

## To sum up on the new git vocabulary

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
- `Clone`, copy the entire contents of a GitHub repository to your local computer (done once per computer)
- `Commit`, move a changed local file to your local staging area 
- `Pull`, get file(s) from the remote to your local computer – opposite of a “push”
- `Push`, move file(s) to the remote from your local computer – opposite of a “pull”

## Let's practice

- Create a new R script (file 2) and edit it
- Stage this new R script in the git repo
- Add a commit to document the added file
- Create a second R script (file 3) in the git repo and edit it
- Repeat steps 4 and 5 for this second script
- Check the git log
- Publish the new files on the remote server (Github)

# Collaborate on Github <br> <span style="font-weight:lighter;font-size:32px">can generate conflicts...</span> {background-color="#40666e"}

## Before we start

Invite a collaborator to your repository on GitHub.

- Go to your repository on GitHub
- Click on the **Settings** tab
- Click on **Manage access** on the left
- Click on **Invite a collaborator**
- Enter the GitHub username of your collaborator
- Click on **Add** to send the invitation

## Before we start

- Accept the invitation from your collaborator
- Clone the repository on your local computer
- Edit an existing file
- Commit the changes
- Push the changes to the remote repository

## `git` conflicts

- A conflict occurs when two or more people edit the same line of code in a file and then try to push their changes to the remote repository.

![](https://www2.stat.duke.edu/courses/Fall19/sta199.001/slides/lab-slides/img/03/merge-conflict-identifiers.png){fig-align="center" width="100%"}

## Strategies to avoid `git` conflicts

1. Communicate with your team members/collaborators often to avoid working on the same files at the same time! Let each other know who is working on what
2. Commit often in small chunks, to avoid complex merges
3. Pull often especially before starting to edit and pushing your changes

## Let's practice

In teams of 2, edit the same file at the same time in the same repository.
Then, try to push your changes to the remote repository. A conflict should occur, let's try to resolve it.
